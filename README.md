# To-Do-List
The to-do list is built using JavaScript, it has a beautiful UI and shows the user today's date, the user adds a new to-do by filling the input and hitting the enter button.

The user can check the to-do when it is done or delete it by clicking on the delete button.

The filled to-do list is stored in the local storage. By clicking the clear button at the top right corner of the app the list will be cleared.
